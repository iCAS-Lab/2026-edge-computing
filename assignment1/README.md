# Assignment 1: Fundamental Machine Learning Models

Assignment Author: Peyton Chandarana

## Objective:

TODO: Write objective

## 0. Preliminaries:

Please familiarize yourself with Python and Jupyter notebooks if you are not familiar with them yet. You will also need to be familiar with using Kaggle. Please see the instructions below.

### Kaggle

We will be using Kaggle later so if you wish to use Kaggle for this assignment it should be familiar in subsequent assignments.

To use on Kaggle, you just need to create your own account with an email address and username you are ok sharing with the instructor/TAs later. You can use your own email or your USC email. Your choice.

Import the provided `main.ipynb` file into a new Kaggle workspace.

Once you have your notebook open you should see the following five sections:

- `# Linear Regression`
- `# Logistic Regression`
- `# Decision Tree`
- `# Random Forest`
- `# Support Vector Machine (SVM)`

In the assignment you will implemented each of these fundamental ML models. Below we give descriptions/instructions to help with the implementation grouped intro three subsections since there is some overlap in the ideas.

## 1. Implement Linear and Logistic Regression

## 2. Implement Decision Tree and Random Forest

## 3. Implement Support Vector Maching (SVM)

## Deliverables

1. A summary of what the code does. This should be a rather thorough summary in your own words. You do not have to summarize each and every cell of the notebook, but your summary should be thorough enough to explain the major steps of the process to someone starting this class in a way that can somewhat understand. Additionally you can include any thoughts you have about what is being done inside the code and why it is being done.

**_We encourage you research the questions as you see fit, but please be sure to CITE the sources you use._**
