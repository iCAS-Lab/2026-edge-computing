# Assignment 1.2: CNNs - VGG + CIFAR-10

Assignment Author: Peyton Chandarana

## Objective:

In this assignment, you will compete to create a VGG inspired convolutional neural network (CNN) to maximize accuracy.

## 0. Preliminaries:

Similar to Assignment 1.1 you can develop your code on Kaggle, Google Colab, or Locally on your machine. You will need to perform this assignment during the class and be checked off at the end.

## 1. Develop and Train VGG-Inspired Network

For this assignment, you will need to perform three steps:

1. Change the dataset from MNIST to CIFAR-10
2. Develop and train a VGG-like network
3. Measure the model's average inference latency for at least N=1000 inputs

## 2. Deliverables

At the very least, you should show that you were able to perform the three steps described above by the end of the course's allocated time. Show that your code is functional (i.e. the model is using CIFAR-10 to train/validate on, the loss is consistently decreasing and accuracy consistently increasing, and an average latency for the model was obtained for at least N=1000 samples)
